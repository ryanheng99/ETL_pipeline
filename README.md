# ETL-Pipeline-1

## ETL Master Data Pipeline

### Overview
This project implements Data Pipeline 1, an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow designed to consolidate master data from multiple manufacturing systems—primarily APRM, DCS, and optionally MES, LIMS, and others—into a unified, validated master table. The pipeline supports scalable integration, robust transformation logic, and downstream analytics enablement.

### Objectives
- Unify disparate data sources into a single master table.
- Standardize and validate incoming data formats.
- Enable traceability across systems for manufacturing analytics.
- Support modular extension for future data sources.
